# This code was made to gave a brief idea of how the Grashof's law works and what kind of a four bars mechanism will be generated with the norm and relations that the user will add.
# soon we'll update to have an animated visualization of the generated four-bars mechanism and its entry angles added for an approximation of what actually happens in everyday life.
# hope it helps!
